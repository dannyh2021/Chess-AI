# Chess-AI
AI that plays chess.

Currently, I've completed and uploaded the first version of this project, which you can check out at https://guarded-dawn-12636.herokuapp.com/ or http://chess.danny-huang.com/.

Currently, the AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a simple evaluation function based on material and piece of position. When I tried to play against it, it plays at least reasonably and could probably defeat beginners. I plan to working on this project and hope to include better UI and a reinforcement learning model in a future update.
